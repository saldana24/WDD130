        website and you business
        
        Why will people come to your site? They will come because no one wants to handle work that can be automated saving owners time and headaches. What questions will your visitors
         expect your site to answer for them? Can I have a demo of the software? What platforms can it interact with? Do i need to be techsavy to use this? What types of activities will visitors
          want to complete on your site? Set up a demo with our people, see prices, see features What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? Email, phone number to set
           up a meeting. After that you will need company name, create an account with owners info and a form of payment for monthly payment. Why will your visitors come to your site instead of anothe
           r to get this information or complete the actions? Been a new company we will offer competitive rates for trying us, we will of course strive to offer the best customer service that cant be
            provided at other big companies.
