            <h2>Intro</h2>
            
         <p class="box2"> You’re great at your trade, you’ve built a first-class small business, and
            you work hard. You’re always ready with a word of advice, a smile, and a
            “Trust me, I’ve got this” attitude. Your customers love what you do, but
            you wish there was just a little more work coming in. So, what’s missing?
            
            You’re probably relying on word-of-mouth more than how your website is ranking, and while you
            always ask your customers to “tell your friends,” they’re busy and they forget. It’s time to dig into
            online reviews—why they matter, the difference they can make, and how they can win you new
            business.

            If you already know your way around “Google My Business” and the importance of great reviews,
            then you can always make things faster and easier, with review automation from Fiveoak. With the
            right approach, you will save time, and can make things much easier for customers so they’re more
            likely to leave a review.
            
            If you’re not a “digital native” you’ll need to get the basics in place but that doesn’t have to be diffi-
            cult or time consuming, and we’re here to help.
